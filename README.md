Annotations on webpack source code in a pseudo-guided fashion.

## Just an Experiment
My goal as one of the maintainers for [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is being able to help developers better understand how webpack works.

Demystify the tool so it helps you become more comfortable understanding how to use it and contributing to our source code and supporting packages.

## Have a question?
The whole goal is to teach you how to use webpack, therefore please ask questions about the annotations you see inside of a github issue, and I will help you clarify any parts of what is seen below. There is **NO wrong question**.

## Disclaimer: This may not match master!
I will likely not keep this up to date with every change in master on webpack/webpack. Rather, the purpose is to teach how to read and view the flow of the compilation lifecycle through webpack.
