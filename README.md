Annotations on webpack source code in a pseudo-guided fashion

## Just an experiment
My goal as one of he maintainers for [webpack](github.com/webpack/webpack) is being able to help developers better understand how webpack works. Demystify to tool so it helps you become more comfortable understanding how to use it. 

## Have a question? 
The whole goal is to teach you how to use webpack, therefore please ask questions about the annotations you see inside of a github issue, and I will help you clarify any parts of what is seen below. There is **NO wrong question**. 

## Disclaimer: This may not match master!
I will likely not keep this up to date with every change in master on webpack/webpack. Rather, the purpose is to teach how to read and view the flow of the compilation lifecycle through webpack.
